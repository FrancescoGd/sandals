## PyQt 5 signal/slot connections performance

The PyQt5 website indicates that using `@pyqtSlot(...)` decreases the amount
of memory required and the speed, although the site is not clear in what way. I wrote 
pyqt5_connections_mem_speed.py to get specifics on this statement. 

This generates the following output on my Windows 7 x64 virtual machine, running on my laptop: 

    Comparing speed for 1000 samples of 1000000 emits
    (Raw: expect approx 1460 sec more to complete)
    (Pyqt Slot: expect approx 1437 sec more to complete)
    
    Raw slot mean, stddev:  1.45 0.019
    Pyqt slot mean, stddev: 1.446 0.015
    Percent gain with pyqtSlot: 0 %

### Signaling speed

The first test compares the speed of signaling with and without the pyqtSlot decorator. 
IOW, is there a difference in speed between using 

   class Handler:
        def slot(self):
            pass

and using 

    class Handler(QObject):
        @pyqtSlot()
        def slot(self):
            pass

when a signal connected to a `handler.slot()` is emitted. The script times how long 
it takes to emit a million signals, and does this a 1000 times. 

The result is not conclusive: the gain is 0% in the above capture, and a couple separate 
run showed around 2-4%. Either way, in a typical application this speed difference would be 
completely irrelevant and unnoticeable. 

### Connection establishment speed

The next test compares the memory used by connections, and the time required to 
establish connections -- no signal emission is involved. This shows that pyqtSlot'd 
methods are about 6 times faster to *connect* to, than "raw" methods. This is significant,
but would only matter in an application where *establishing* raw connections was a significant 
portion of the total cpu time of the application, not a common occurrence IMO. 

For example, 
if half the CPU time of an app is establishing raw connections (presumably because a huge
number of objects are being created and destroyed that either emit or receive), then 
switching to pyqtSlot'd methods could bring this down by 45% approximately. But in most
GUI applications, establishing connections is likely to be sporadic, when dialog windows
are opened, threads started, graphics scene objects created, lists populated. These 
operations involve, in my experience, much more than just establishing a few connections; 
various functions must be called, classes instantiates etc. I doubt the speed effect 
would be noticeble, but it is good to know how it could be affected, and this information
could certainly help focus profiling: if you see a reaction to a click take a long 
time, take a quick look at the number of raw connections established as a result of the 
click, compared to the rest of the code involved in reacting to the click. 

### Connection memory

In terms of memory, the test shows that establishing connections to raw methods take somewhere 
between 10 and 80 more memory than to pyqtSlot'd methods. The accuracy is rather low due 
presumably to platform-dependent limitations of memory size computation, although the numbers 
are consistent across runs. It would be nice to have a more accurate measurement, but if we
take those numbers at face value, 1000 pyqtSlot'd connections uses about 20k, vs 440k for the
same number of raw connections. Since 1000 connections at any given time is again not very 
likely, and 440k is really not worth worrying about on a desktop, most applications don't 
need to care. It would certainly be important where memory is at a premium like (current) mobile 
devices and embedded systems. I suppose establishin a 1000+ connections is possible in a GUI 
table view where each row of the table model is listening for changes from a data object. 

Feedback on the above would be most appreciated, it is very easy to get performance analyses 
wrong!

### Wrapping slots

Sometimes it is necessary to wrap a slot in a function that does extra stuff before and/or after
the slot is called. For example, 
say you want to wrap all your slots with a function that will catch any exception raised while
the slot is called, log the error somewhere and continue gracefully (useful during 
development!). You could achieve this by replacing this: 

    class Handler(QObject):
        @pyqtSlot()
        def slot(self):
            pass

by this: 

    def slot_wrapper(func):
        def wrapped_slot():
            ... do extra stuff...
            func()
    
        pyqt_slot = pyqtSlot()(wrapped_slot)
        assert pyqt_slot is wrapped_slot
        return pyqt_slot

    class Handler(QObject):
        @slot_wrapper
        def slot(self):
            pass

Given that the return value of `pyqtSlot()(wrapped_slot)` is `wrapped_slot`, and the latter is not a method 
on a QObject but just a bare function, I wondered if the wrapped version would have the same memory and time
performance as a raw slot. The script `pyqt5_connections_mem_speed.py` can test this by setting `USE_WRAPPED_SLOT`
to True. The results don't change. According to the PyQt5 author Phil Thompson, the handler's meta object 
is what provides the memory and speed improvements, and indeed inspecting the handler.metaObject() using the 
Python debugger** reveals that `wrapped_slot` is in it (somehow!). So wrapping a pyqtSlot'd method still
maintains the memory and speed advantages of unwrapped pyqtSlot'd methods.

** Footnote: 

    meta = handler.metaObject()
    meta_methods = [str(meta.method(i).methodSignature())
                    for i in range(meta.methodOffset(), meta.methodCount())]
    print(meta_methods)
